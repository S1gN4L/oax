# OpenArena Admin Credits #
The OpenArena Admin System is an integration of the Admin System from the Tremulous project.   It was originally written by Tony J. White, a major contributor to the Tremulous project, and project leader of the ETPub mod for Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory.

As a derivative of the Tremulous project, it should also be noted that it also "Contains contributions from Wesley van Beelen, Chris Bajumpaa, Josh Menke, and Travis Maurer." (Quoted Directly from the Source Code).

Much appreciation goes out to Tony and his team members for doing so much of the leg work.
