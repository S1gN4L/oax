# OpenArena Server Administration #

## Overview ##
Beginning in OAX Beta 40, OpenArena employs a server administration system designed to empower **Server Operators** and **Clans** in managing gameplay on their servers.  Several key features are:

  * RCON-less commands. (No need to worry about your RCON password out in the wild!)
  * IP and GUID based Player Kicking/Banning
  * Admin Name Protection
  * Customizable Admin Levels (Up to 32 different levels)
  * Customizable Server Commands
  * Player Spam Protection (Chat, Voice Chat, and Name Changes)
  * Auditable Admin Logs

Server Operators and Clans who utilize the OpenArena admin system are not bound by a "one size fits all" environment.  They have the flexibility to make their server's gameplay experience as unique as they want, and as best as they know how.
