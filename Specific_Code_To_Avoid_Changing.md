## Summary ##

I will post a list of parts of code to avoid changing.  The "identifier" of the code will be listed and as well as the file it is contained in. The following are reasons code will get listed here:

  1. The code was originally designed to interface with the engine in a certain way and changing it will require changing the engine code to avoid crashing the game.
  1. Any and all possible changes to the code crashes the game.  (This is usually due to the first condition!)

## List of Code ##

Will list things as I come across them.
